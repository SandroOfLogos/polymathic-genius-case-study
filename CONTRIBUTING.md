Thank you for helping improve the case study. Please follow these guidelines.

## Philosophy
- Scientific literacy, logos-first reasoning, falsifiability.
- Reliability over rhetoric: include sources, define constructs, show work.
- Prefer **square charts** (2×2, 3×3, 4×4) for conceptual clarity.

## Style
- Markdown only for docs; keep sections short with headers.
- Use APA-style references where applicable.
- Keep claims testable; separate *evidence* from *inference*.

## PR Checklist
- [ ] Adds/edits a single chapter (or clearly scoped feature).
- [ ] Includes/updates a relevant chart in `charts/`.
- [ ] Updates `RESEARCH_NOTES.md` with rationale.
- [ ] Passes `scripts/validate_repo.py` (basic hygiene).
