# Abstract

This repository documents a case study of a high-functioning polymath (age 35) whose outputs span psychology, history, genealogy, somatics, martial practice, visual arts, contemplative sciences, and applied therapeutic systems. We quantify rarity, reliability, and genius using psychometric validity (IQ, Big Five), historical benchmarks (great works), and embodied performance metrics.

**Checkpoint IQ estimate**: 175â€“180 (Profound Polymathic Genius), with upward elasticity contingent on published great works and AI-era impact.
